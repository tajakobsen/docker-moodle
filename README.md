[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/jhardison/moodle.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/jhardison/moodle "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")

Intended for testing with h5p. You probably want [Jonathan Hardison's](https://github.com/jmhardison/docker-moodle) solution instead.

## Running
```
docker-compose up
```

This is a form of [Jonathan Hardison's](https://github.com/jmhardison/docker-moodle) setup
Which again is a fork of [Jon Auer's](https://github.com/jda/docker-moodle) Dockerfile.
This is a reductionist take on [sergiogomez](https://github.com/sergiogomez/)'s docker-moodle Dockerfile.
